title: A New Design
---

Yesterday I was kind of fed up with the unpleasant design of my blog, and decided to do something about that.

An attractive solution is migrating to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). But that way I could no longer rely on Github to build and host the pages for me.

Then I found [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), a simple yet powerful framework. Since it does not include any plugins, pages can still be built and hosted on Github. I was so excited and definitely tried it, but was not fully satisfied with its DOM structure.

Of course I can customize JB to fit my needs, but suddenly I realized what I really need is just a new design. Although I am not a designer, I can utilize my newly learned knowledge of CSS and make it look better. And this is the result.

Please feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions about this site. I'd be glad to hear your thoughts!
