This morning after I woke up, my dad told me that my book has arrived.

"I opened the envelope because it was somewhat damp." he explains.

Damn postal service. But what book?

The envelope from Chicaco almost answered my question. Yes, the book lying next to the envelope is [Eric Sink](http://www.ericsink.com/)'s [Version Control by Example](http://www.ericsink.com/vcbe/).

I requested a free copy of the book, and totally forgot about that. I didn't expect such a nice book would be mailed overseas to my house, for free. But now the book is on my desk.

Thank you, Eric!
